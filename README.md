## Key Features:
### Space Assessment:
The platform provides a user-friendly interface to input basic details about the company, its building, and operations. This data forms the foundation for our analysis.

### Energy Efficiency Insights:
By analyzing energy consumption patterns and building specifications, we provide actionable insights on how to improve energy efficiency. Our platform recommends energy-saving measures tailored to each business's unique needs.

### Renewable Energy Potential:
Through a solar potential calculator, we evaluate the viability of integrating solar panels based on location, roof orientation, and angle. This empowers businesses to harness renewable energy and reduce reliance on traditional power sources.

### Commute Optimization:
We assess the existing transportation options available to employees. Using geospatial data, we suggest eco-friendly alternatives, such as public transportation and cycling routes, to reduce emissions from daily commutes.

### Waste Management Strategies:
Our platform offers insights into current waste management practices and recommends strategies to minimize waste and improve recycling efforts.

### Green Building Certification Assistance:
For businesses aiming to achieve green building certification, we provide guidance on requirements and best practices to ensure compliance and sustainability.

### Energy Audit Support:
Companies can access resources for conducting energy audits, a crucial step toward identifying further areas for improvement.


## Impact:
Our project seeks to create a positive impact on the environment, businesses, and society as a whole:

### Environmental Impact: 
By promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy adoption, we contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the effects of climate change.

### Business Efficiency: 
Companies adopting sustainable practices often experience reduced operational costs, enhanced brand reputation, and improved employee satisfaction.

### Community Engagement: 
Our commute optimization features encourage employees to choose eco-friendly transportation options, thereby reducing congestion and improving air quality in local communities.
